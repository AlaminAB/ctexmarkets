                                            <p>3.2 The following is an overview of the CTEXMarkets Group’s purposes for processing Personal Information. Please remember that additional information may be provided to you in a separate notice, or in our terms and conditions. In addition to 1.5, in the event of any conflict between any separate notice and our terms and conditions, our terms and conditions shall take precedence.</p>
                                            <p>3.3 All processing of Personal Information which we undertake is justified by a “condition” for processing. In addition, processing of sensitive Personal Information is always justified by a secondary condition. In the majority of cases, processing will be justified on the basis that:
                                            <p>3.3.1 you have consented to the processing;</p>
                                            <p>3.3.2 the processing is necessary to perform a contract or to take steps to enter into a contract</p>
                                            <p>3.3.3 the processing is necessary for us to comply with a relevant legal obligation</p>
                                            <p>3.3.4 the processing is in our legitimate commercial interests, subject to your interests and fundamental rights.</p>
                                            <p>3.4 The purposes for which we process your Personal Information are to:
                                            <p>3.4.1 provide you with specific services in accordance with a contract you are entering, or have entered into with us;</p>

                                            <p>3.4.3 on-board you as a client and to carry out background and screening checks</p>
                                            <p>3.4.4 compile and maintain files on prospective and current directors and qualified advisors, and to carry out background and screening checks on the same, in order to comply with regulatory requirements;</p>
                                            <p>3.4.5 carry out regulatory reporting (for instance, under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, and from 2018, the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation);</p>
                                            <p>3.4.6 provide you with newsletters or alerts where you have signed-up for these on the Website;</p>
                                            <p>3.4.7 conduct market research surveys, where you choose to participate in these;</p>
                                            <p>3.4.8 run competitions;</p>
                                            <p>3.4.9 analyse usage of the Website (see more information in relation to our use of analytics tools below);</p>

                                            <p>3.5 We may send you direct marketing communications. Where these are electronic communications (email or telephone) we will have obtained your prior consent. In limited circumstances, where we have obtained your explicit prior consent, we may send you marketing communications in relation to carefully selected and relevant third party partners, whose products and services may be of interest to you.
